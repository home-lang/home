## 🚨 Critical Warnings

### Before You Start, Understand:

1. **This is HARD**: Building a compiler takes years
2. **Solo = 3-4 years**: Not 18-24 months
3. **Borrow checker is complex**: Will take months to get right
4. **Speed claims must be validated**: Benchmark from Week 6
5. **Community matters**: Can't do this alone

**If this sounds daunting**: Read [PITFALLS.md](./PITFALLS.md) for full context
