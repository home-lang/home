// Spread Operator Tests
// Tests array/tuple unpacking

// Test 1: Basic spread in tuple
let arr1 = (1, 2, 3);

// Test 2: Spread at beginning
let arr2 = (4, 5, 6);

// Test 3: Spread in middle
let arr3 = (2, 3);
let spread3 = (1, ...arr3, 4);

// Test 4: Multiple spreads
let a1 = (1, 2);
let a2 = (3, 4);
let combined = (...a1, ...a2);

// Test 5: Spread with single element
let single = (42,);
let expanded = (...single, 43);

// Test 6: Nested spread
let inner = (5, 6);
let outer = (1, 2, ...inner, 7);

// Test 7: Spread empty tuple
let empty = ();
let withEmpty = (1, ...empty, 2);

// Test 8: Three-way spread
let part1 = (1,);
let part2 = (2,);
let part3 = (3,);

// Note: spread in function calls would need special handling

// Test 10: Spread with arithmetic
